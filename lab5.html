        <h3>
          Client Error 4xx
        </h3>

        <p>
          The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when
          responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the error
          situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any
          request method. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP SHOULD be careful to ensure that the client
          acknowledges receipt of the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the input connection.
          If the client continues sending data to the server after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset
          packet to the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and
          interpreted by the HTTP application.
        </p>

        <h3>
          400 Bad Request
        </h3>

        <p>
          The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the
          request without modifications.
        </p>

        <h3>
          401 Unauthorized
        </h3>

        <p>
          The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section
          14.47) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a
          suitable Authorization header field. If the request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401
          response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains
          the same challenge as the prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least
          once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response, since that entity might
          include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in "HTTP Authentication:
          Basic and Digest Access Authentication".

        <h3>
          402 Payment Required
        </h3>

        <p>
          This code is reserved for future use.
        </p>

        <h3>
          403 Forbidden
        </h3>

        <p>
          The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request
          SHOULD NOT be repeated. If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the
          request has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in the entity. If the server
          does not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used
          instead.
        </p>

        <h3>
          404 Not Found
        </h3>

        <p>
          The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition
          is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some
          internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding
          address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request
          has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
